# Le Fournil des fleurs

## Contents

The unchanged vite-generated files: `.gitignore`, `index.html`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite-config` files.

A `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`) file with ESLint, Prettier and their dependencies removed. Biome and TailwindCSS are installed as devDependencies. Available scripts are:

- `dev`, `build`, `preview` as provided by Vite
- `format`: formats the project using Biome's formatter
- `lint`: lints the project using Biome's linter

Biome config file `biome.json`. In addition to default config, it has git integration enabled, and has the experimental useSortedClasses (sorting of tailwind classes) rule enabled.

Lefthook config file `lefthook.yml` with pre-commit hooks for Biome and TypeScript type checking.
